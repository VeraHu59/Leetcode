DFS can be used in following typical situations:
1. Find all solutions(combination & permutation)
2. Find the longest/shortest solution(Dynamic Programming)

Recursion must have three elements:
1. Definition
2. Break Down
3. Exit

The time complexity of DFS: 0(# of solution * time complexity of each solution)
