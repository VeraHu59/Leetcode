# Introduction

This file contains solutions of leetcode algorithm questions.

The solution for each question contains three parts:

> - Explaination of solution 
> - Analysis of time/space complexity
> - Several solutions for this question written in Python


I hope this file can track my journey of learning data structure and algorithm. Moreover, I hope this file can help those who are struggling with Leetcode as I do.


I will keep updating this file.
